# Linear Algebra Library

This library hosts C++ implementation of some of the routines which are most frequently encountered in Linear Algebra.

## Installation
The project can be configured using CMake. The steps for the same are given below:

+ Create a directory where you want the binaries to build. Let's call it the build directory.

```shell
mkdir build
```
+ Change the working directory to the build directory and run CMake as follows:

```shell
cd build
cmake ..
```

+ After the configuration is complete, the Makefile is generated inside the build directory. You can now compile the project and run the executable as follows:

```shell
make
./LinearAlgebra
```
